## **Overview**

At Mayar, security is a core principle we uphold in everything we do. We continuously improve our security posture through proactive assessments, rigorous testing, and a commitment to industry best practices, compliance and certification.[**​**](https://docs.hitpayapp.com/security#data-security)

## **Data Security**

- **AES Encryption:** All databases and client communications use AES encryption.
- **Encryption at Rest:** Sensitive data is encrypted when stored in our systems.
- **Encryption in Transit:** Data traveling to PlanetScale databases is protected using TLS, and all communications to the Mayar API and Dashboard are served exclusively over HTTPS (TLS 1.3).

## [**​**](https://docs.hitpayapp.com/security#compliance-%26-testing)**Compliance & Testing**

- **PCI-DSS Compliant:** We maintain PCI-DSS compliance. A copy of our PCI certificate is available upon request (under NDA) via https://trust.mayar.id/
- **SOC 2:** We also maintain SOC 2 compliance to further validate our security, availability, and confidentiality controls.
- **External Penetration Testing:** We regularly engage independent security experts to conduct external penetration tests. These assessments are performed at a higher standard than the minimum requirements set by regulators, ensuring that our systems remain resilient against evolving threats.

## [**​**](https://docs.hitpayapp.com/security#account-security-%26-shared-responsibility)**Account Security & Shared Responsibility**

At Mayar, securing account access is a shared responsibility between us and our merchant partners. We enforce strict controls to ensure that only authorized personnel can access sensitive information:

- **Google Sign-in Only:** Google sign-in and 2FA from Google is a world standard in security, reducing risk of password usage and sim-swap risk.
- **Role-Based Access Controls:** Each team member is assigned specific permissions aligned with their role, reducing the risk of misuse.
- **One Time Password (OTP)**: For withdrawing or disbursing money, our system always ask for OTP for security.
- **Password Sharing:** We highly recommend not sharing your account passwords with your staff. Instead, each individual should use their own credentials to maintain accountability.

By following these guidelines, we work together to maintain a secure and reliable access environment.
