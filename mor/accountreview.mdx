### **Continuous reviews (Async)**

We continuously monitor all transactions across our platform to proactively prevent fraud. In addition to performing asynchronous reviews of accounts at certain sale thresholds. These reviews are often completed within hours and without any additional information required from you. You’ll get notified over email that a review is taking place. Payouts will be paused during this time, but it has no impact on your customers’ experience or ability to purchase, subscribe or checkout at any time. We look at:

- Risk scores across historic transactions
- Refund- & Chargeback ratio
- Appropriate next sales threshold for a review given the above

**High chargeback ratios**

Credit card networks, e.g Visa/Mastercard, consider 0.7% of sales in chargebacks excessive. Exceeding it can lead to monitoring programs with high costs, penalties and ultimately termination.We therefore reach out proactively to collaborate on maintaining a low chargeback ratio and reducing it ahead of getting close to these thresholds.

#### **Chargeback Management**

We monitor chargeback rates closely to protect both merchants and customers:

- **Acceptable Threshold**: We maintain a chargeback rate threshold of 0.4% for merchants
- **Timeframe**: Chargebacks can be filed up to 120 days from the original transaction date
- **Consequences of High Chargeback Rates**: We work proactively to maintain a low chargeback rate throughout the platform and strive to collaborate with merchants at risk of exceeding our thresholds to reverse the trend. However, we reserve the right to (in order of severity):
  - Refund transactions as needed
  - Pause payouts pending review – up until the timeframe for chargebacks have been surpassed
  - Pause future payments
  - Block accounts and refund customers

  We don’t take this responsibility or actions lightly, and always strive to mitigate and avoid them, but have to take appropriate and proactive actions in case of issues.

#### **Policy Violations**

For merchants who violate our **acceptable use policies** (and don’t have high chargeback rates):

- **Immediate Action**: We will offboard merchants who violate our policies
- **Payment Processing**: All payment processing will be blocked
- **Payout Management**: Payouts will be paused pending review
- **Resolution Process**:
  - We may conduct test transactions to verify account status
  - In case of strong suspicion of fraud or intentional abuse, we block the account immediately
  - We reach out merchants about the issue and give them 48 hours to respond
    - Failure to respond may result in refunds to affected customers
  - We pause future payments in the meantime if deemed necessary
  - We pause payouts during the resolution process
  - We strive to collaborate with merchants on the best possible path forward. Clear fraud or abuse, however, is immediately blocked.
  - We have to cancel subscriptions and refund payments made in violation of our acceptable use policies for compliance and risk, and strive to do so in collaboration with the merchant.
