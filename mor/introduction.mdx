### **What is a Merchant of Record?**

As merchant of record, we provide seamless checkout, commerce platform and payment to our merchant. But, Mayar is not a typical global merchant of record who also manage global sales tax for their merchant. Therefore we do not (not-yet) include sales tax processing in our platform, our merchants must process the sales tax reporting and payment by themselves.

### **Payment Service Providers vs. Merchants of Record**

**Payment Service Providers (PSPs)**

Xendit, Doku and other Payment Service Providers (PSPs) offer an accessible and convenient abstraction to faciliate transactions on top of underlying credit card network, banks and e-wallets.

- ✅ Powerful, flexibile & low-level APIs to facilitate transactions
- ❌ Can be used to power all business- and pricing models under the sun.
- ❌ You are responsible for all liabilities associated with transactions, e.g international taxes
- ❌ Low-level APIs require more development even for common use cases

**Merchants of Record (MoRs)**

Merchants of Record offer yet another layer of convenient abstraction to facilitate digital orders on top of the underlying PSPs and transactions. E.g Mayar is built on Xendit and/or Doku (\+ more PSPs in the future).

- ✅ Higher-level Dashboard, APIs & SDKs to better facilitate digital products, services & orders beyond the underlying transactions
- ✅ No-code solution available for no-tech people
- ✅ No API Integration option available. Ready to use, sell faster
- ❌ Higher fees per payment
