## Get Started

Headless API is an e-commerce development method where the user interface (Frontend) is separated from the product management and transaction processing systems (Backend). In headless commerce, the front-end can be built using various modern web technologies such as React or Vue.js, while the back-end performs tasks such as product storage, order processing, and integration with payment systems.

By separating the front-end and back-end, headless commerce allows development teams to focus on the user experience without being hampered by the limitations of the underlying e-commerce platform. It also helps reduce the cost and time required to update and maintain an e-commerce site.

## Authentication

For starting using Mayar Headless API, you need account at https://mayar.id. If you have an account, you can create API KEY from https://web.mayar.id/api-keys.

<Warning>
  For your account security, don't share your API KEY\!
</Warning>

<Note>
  Please note that any changes to your domain or subdomain require you to create a new API KEY, so the link in the response you receive will also be updated.
</Note>

## Sandbox Environment

For testing purposes, you can use the webpage https://web.mayar.club/. You can log in or register first, then generate an API key from https://web.mayar.club/api-keys. (The same method as obtaining an API key on the production page).

## Base URL

The API Base URL is the main part of the address (URL) used to access an API endpoint. Mayar has two API Base URL's based on the page.

<Note>
  Make sure you use a base URL based on the appropriate web page (Production or Sandbox)
