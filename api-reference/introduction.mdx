## Get Started

Headless API is an e-commerce development method where the user interface (Frontend) is separated from the product management and transaction processing systems (Backend). In headless commerce, the front-end can be built using various modern web technologies such as React or Vue.js, while the back-end performs tasks such as product storage, order processing, and integration with payment systems.

By separating the front-end and back-end, headless commerce allows development teams to focus on the user experience without being hampered by the limitations of the underlying e-commerce platform. It also helps reduce the cost and time required to update and maintain an e-commerce site.
