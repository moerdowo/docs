### Overview

The WhatsApp (Unofficial) in MAYAR enables businesses to send and receive transaction notifications effectively. With this feature, users can send various important updates to customers, such as payment receipts, order confirmations, membership payment requests, and payment reminders. By using WhatsApp, this information is delivered instantly and directly to the customer, ensuring they are always informed about the status of their transactions. This not only improves transparency and customer trust but also helps businesses manage transaction-related communication more efficiently.

<Note>
  This is a beta feature. Please contact the admin via live chat or email at [cs@mayar.id](mailto:cs@mayar.id) to activate this feature. Currently, it is only available for merchants with active transactions for the past 3 months.
