### What is MCP?

Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard that allows AI models to securely connect to various data sources and external tools. It provides a unified way for AI applications to interact with different services, databases, and APIs, while maintaining proper security and access control.

The MCP Server acts as a bridge between AI models and external systems, enabling the model to:

- Access real-time data from external services
- Perform functions and operations on behalf of the user
- Maintain secure authentication and authorization processes
- Deliver structured responses that the model can understand

Mayar MCP Server specifically provides AI models with full access to transaction data, customer data, balances, and many other data pointsâ€”making it easier for you to manage your business and gain valuable insights with AI.
