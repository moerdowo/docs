### Overview

Mayar MCP Server allows AI to securely connect with transaction data, customer information, balances, and various external services through the open standard Model Context Protocol (MCP). With this connection, AI can access real-time data, perform functions on behalf of the user, maintain secure authentication and authorization, and deliver structured responses that are easy to understand. This integration helps your business run more efficiently while providing smart insights to support AI-driven decision making.

### What is MCP?

Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard that allows AI models to securely connect to various data sources and external tools. It provides a unified way for AI applications to interact with different services, databases, and APIs, while maintaining proper security and access control.

The MCP Server acts as a bridge between AI models and external systems, enabling the model to:

- Access real-time data from external services
- Perform functions and operations on behalf of the user
- Maintain secure authentication and authorization processes
- Deliver structured responses that the model can understand

Mayar MCP Server specifically provides AI models with full access to transaction data, customer data, balances, and many other data pointsâ€”making it easier for you to manage your business and gain valuable insights with AI.
