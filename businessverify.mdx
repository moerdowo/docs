### Overview

Business verification is a crucial step in setting up your MAYAR account. This process helps us ensure the safety and legitimacy of all businesses using our platform.

### Why is Business Verification Required?

MAYAR, like many platforms, requires business verification to ensure security, legal compliance, user trust, and to protect the platform as a whole. It also helps us provide a better and safer user experience by making sure registered businesses are legitimate, reducing fraud risk, and maintaining the platform’s integrity and reputation.

### Business Verification Form

The **Business Verification Form** is a detailed form that collects important information about your business. This information helps our team evaluate and verify your business operations. MAYAR provides 5 types of verification, based on the type of business entity: Individual, Business, Foundation (Non-profit), Limited Liability Company (PT), and Sole Proprietorship (PT Perorangan).
