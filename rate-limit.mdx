> Mayar API rate limits and best practices for handling them.

Mayar API has rate limits to ensure fair usage and maintain performance. The limits are as follows:

- 20 requests per minute per IP address.

If you exceed the rate limit, you will receive a **429 Too Many Requests** response. The response will include a \*\*Retry-After \*\*header indicating how long you should wait before making another request.
