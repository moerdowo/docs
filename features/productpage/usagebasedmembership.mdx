### Overview

The credit-based membership system in Mayar lets you sell software with a monthly credit system. Credits can either reset or roll over at the end of each billing cycle, and members can top up credits during their subscription. You can set the price per credit and define minimum and maximum top-up limits. The system prioritizes the use of **membership credits** before **add-on credits**, and older credits are used first. Credits do not transfer if a member switches tiers. An API is available to manage credits, including registering new members with trial credits. Webhooks are also enabled for notifications of the first purchase and top-ups, giving you full flexibility and control over membership management on Mayar.
