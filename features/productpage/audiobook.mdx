4. In the **“Create Audio Book”** window, you will need to provide detailed product information, such as **Product Name** and **Payment Type**. Mayar offers three payment options: Paid Product, Free Product, and Pay-What-You-Want Product. If you choose Paid Product, you must enter the Price and optionally a Strikethrough Price. If you select Pay-What-You-Want, you need to set a Minimum Price. You should also add the Product Description, Cover Image, Start Sale Date, and Expiry Date. Don’t forget to include Notes, Maximum Purchase Quantity (Quota/QTY), and File Source — you can either upload a new file or use one that has been uploaded before. You can also decide whether the product can be downloaded. For **Additional Details** (optional), you can include information such as the Narrator, Format (Mayar supports WAV, MP3, AAC, FLAC, and OGG), Audiobook Duration, and whether the product can be part of the affiliate program.
