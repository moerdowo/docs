If all looks good, you have successfully created a Fundraising Campaign on Mayar.

### Share Fundraising Campaign

1. Once the fundraising campaign is created, you can copy and paste or share it directly with your customers.
2. When the customer clicks the fundraising link, available payment methods linked to your Mayar account will be displayed.

### Managing Fundraising Link

You have access to a default fundraising link in the Mayar dashboard under Fundraising. This default link, when shared with customers, allows them to manually enter the amount they want to send/pay to you.

Below are the steps involved in managing the default fundraising link:

1. **Click on Fundraising** in the left sidebar. You can copy the default link from here, which can then be directly shared with any customer. Additionally, you can add the link to any order-taking form or embed it as a button on your website.

### **Locating Deactivate Button and View Details Page**

1. **Unpublished Default Link:** If you wish to temporarily disable the default fundraising link and prevent further access, click the dropdown published button, then select “unpublished.” This can be valuable when you need to suspend the link temporarily.
2. **View Details Page:** For a deeper understanding of your default fundraising campaign, select the "view" hyperlink for each product. This action will navigate you to the Details Page, where you can explore revenue insights and access a complete payment history.

## Detail Fundraising Page

You can see Link to share Fundraising on page including the data:

- Share order link section
  - **Copy Payment Link:** Link directing to the payment page.
