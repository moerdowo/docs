### Overview

SaaS (Software as a Service) is a software delivery model provided over the internet. It allows users to access applications from multiple devices without the need to download or install them locally. On the Mayar platform, SaaS offers high flexibility and scalability, enabling businesses to adjust their software usage based on their needs without requiring large upfront investments in IT infrastructure. Updates and maintenance are handled by the service provider, so users can focus on their core business activities without worrying about technical issues. Data security and easy access are key advantages of SaaS, making it a popular choice for businesses looking to improve operational efficiency and team collaboration.
