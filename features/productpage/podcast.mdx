### Creating a Podcast Product

1. First, log in to your Mayar Dashboard. Make sure you are signed in to your account and on the main Dashboard page. Here, you will begin the process of creating a Podcast product.
2. On the Dashboard page, find and click the **“Product”** button located at the top right corner, next to the **“Create”** button. This will take you to the product menu, where you can choose the type of product you want to create.
3. From the product menu, select the **“Podcast”** option to start creating your Podcast product. This will open a new window titled **“Create Podcast”**, where you’ll be asked to provide various details about the product you’re making.
4. In the **“Create Podcast”** window, you will need to fill in the product details such as **Product Name** and **Payment Type**. Mayar offers three payment options: Paid Product, Free Product, and Pay-What-You-Want Product. If you select Paid Product, you must enter the Price and optionally a Strikethrough Price. If you choose Pay-What-You-Want, you need to set a Minimum Price. You should also add the Product Description, Cover Image, Start Sale Date, and Expiry Date. Don’t forget to include Notes, Maximum Purchase Quantity (Quota/QTY), and File Source — either upload a new file or use one that has been uploaded before. You can also decide whether the product can be downloaded. For Additional Details (optional), you can include information such as the Speaker, Podcast Duration, and whether the product can be part of the affiliate program.
5. Once all the information is filled in and your Podcast product is created, you’ll be redirected to the product detail page, where you can review all the information. Congratulations — you’ve successfully created a Podcast product on Mayar\!

### Accessing Your Podcast Product

After purchasing a Podcast product, you can access it in several ways. You can listen to it directly from the **“Thank You”** page that appears once your purchase is complete. You will also receive a confirmation email containing a link to access your Podcast, and you can use this link anytime via the customer portal. Be sure to keep the confirmation email so you can easily access your Podcast whenever you want.
