### Overview

Product bundling on the Mayar platform is a sales strategy where multiple products or services are combined into a single package, offered at a more attractive price than if purchased separately. The main goal of bundling is to provide more value to customers while increasing sales for sellers. With product bundling, customers can find complementary items packaged together — for example, a skincare bundle that includes a facial cleanser, toner, and moisturizer. Customers benefit from a lower overall price, the convenience of getting everything they need in one purchase, and added value from products or services they might not buy individually. For sellers, bundling can help boost sales, reduce excess inventory, and build customer loyalty by offering more appealing deals.

### Access and Display of Bundled Products for Customers

In Mayar, bundled products can be accessed through the customer portal page and the payment receipt email. The pricing of bundled products follows the price set during the bundle creation. On the checkout page, the difference between the total price of the individual products and the bundle price you entered during setup will be shown.

On the bundled product page, you will usually see a main image that attracts attention, a clear product title, and a short description of the bundle. Price information and a "BUY NOW" button are provided to make it easy for customers to complete their purchase. There is also a list of the products included in the bundle with the price of each item, so customers know exactly what they are getting. At the bottom of the page, you will typically find links to site policies and a language option for user convenience.

On the customer portal, bundled products are grouped together—starting with the bundle itself, followed by the products included in it. Usually, products that are part of a bundle will have the label “(bundling)” after their product type.
