### Overview

Product bundling on the Mayar platform is a sales strategy where multiple products or services are combined into a single package, offered at a more attractive price than if purchased separately. The main goal of bundling is to provide more value to customers while increasing sales for sellers. With product bundling, customers can find complementary items packaged together — for example, a skincare bundle that includes a facial cleanser, toner, and moisturizer. Customers benefit from a lower overall price, the convenience of getting everything they need in one purchase, and added value from products or services they might not buy individually. For sellers, bundling can help boost sales, reduce excess inventory, and build customer loyalty by offering more appealing deals.
