### Overview

Product bundling on the Mayar platform is a sales strategy where multiple products or services are combined into a single package, offered at a more attractive price than if purchased separately. The main goal of bundling is to provide more value to customers while increasing sales for sellers. With product bundling, customers can find complementary items packaged together — for example, a skincare bundle that includes a facial cleanser, toner, and moisturizer. Customers benefit from a lower overall price, the convenience of getting everything they need in one purchase, and added value from products or services they might not buy individually. For sellers, bundling can help boost sales, reduce excess inventory, and build customer loyalty by offering more appealing deals.

3. A "Create Bundling" modal form will appear. Fill in the required information: Bundle Name, Select Products to Include, Price, Cover Image (for promotion), Description, Expiry Date, Post-Purchase Message/Notes, Quantity (qty), and Redirect URL. You can also set a commission percentage if you want to make the bundle available for affiliate marketing.

### Access and Display of Bundled Products on the Public Page

In Mayar, bundled products can be accessed through the customer portal page and the payment receipt email. The pricing of a bundled product follows the price set during its creation. On the checkout page, users will see the price difference between the total of individual products and the bundled price that was set. The admin fee depends on the chosen Mayar plan: 3% for Starter, 2% for Business, and 0% for Enterprise. On the portal page, bundled products are grouped together — starting with the bundled product itself, followed by the individual products included within it. Typically, these included products are labeled with “(bundling)” after their product type.
