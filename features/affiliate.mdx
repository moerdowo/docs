### Overview

The Affiliate feature on Mayar allows users to earn additional income by promoting the services or products offered on the platform. Users who join the affiliate program will receive a unique link that can be shared with others. Every time someone makes a transaction through that link, the affiliate user will earn a commission based on a predetermined percentage. This program is designed to incentivize users to expand Mayar’s reach and increase the number of transactions on the platform. As a result, the affiliate feature benefits not only the participating users but also helps Mayar grow its visibility and customer base.
