### Overview

The Mayar dashboard serves as the main control center for users to monitor their sales activities, transactions, and overall business performance. At the top, you can see the **Account Balance**, which can be used for top-ups or withdrawals, along with special links such as the **PayMe Link** for receiving payments and the **Customer Portal,** where customers can access services. The dashboard also shows **Lifetime Revenue**, giving users a clear view of their total earnings.

A chart section displays **Transactions & Revenue** over the past year as well as earnings from the last 30 days, helping users analyze sales trends. On the right side, youâ€™ll find a list of the most recent transactions, the latest customer reviews (useful for evaluating service or product quality), and a list of unpaid invoices to make follow-ups easier.

Overall, this dashboard helps users manage their products, track sales performance, engage with customers through reviews, and keep cash flow under control.

- Track sales & revenue
