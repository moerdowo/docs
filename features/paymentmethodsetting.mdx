### Overview

The Payment Method Settings page on Mayar is designed to make it easy for users to manage the various payment methods available for their business. On this page, users can add, remove, or customize payment preferences such as credit cards, bank transfers, e-wallets, and more. With an intuitive interface, users can easily enable or disable specific payment methods based on their business needs. Additionally, this page offers options to configure automated payments, ensuring all transactions are smooth and efficient. With this feature, Mayar gives users full flexibility and control in optimizing the payment experience for their customers.

### Charging Transaction Fees to Customers

Both the Channel Fee and Admin Fee can be charged to your customers (meaning your transaction amount will remain unchanged, and the fees will be added to your customer’s total payment). You can enable this option by going to Settings → Payment Methods tab.
