### Overview

The Balance Page on the Mayar app is designed to give users a complete overview of their balance and financial activities. It shows up-to-date information about account balance, recent transactions, and visual expense analysis, making it easier to manage finances effectively. 

### Short Explanation About Balance in MAYAR

**Active Balance:** This is the amount of money available for you to use or withdraw anytime. It has passed all verification and clearance processes, so it’s ready to use.

**Pending Balance:** This is money from confirmed transactions that is still being processed by the payment channel (Bank, Credit Card Provider, Alfamart, Indomaret, or E-Wallet Provider) and is on the way to Mayar.

**Settlement Time:** This is the time it takes for a payment to move from “received” to “active balance.” The duration may vary depending on the payment method and the policies of the bank or payment provider. Typically, it can take from a few hours up to several business days.
