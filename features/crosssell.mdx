### Overview

Mayar’s Cross-Sell feature is designed to help sellers increase their revenue by suggesting relevant additional products or services to customers during the purchase process. This feature intelligently analyzes customer shopping behavior and preferences to recommend items they might be interested in. Seamlessly integrated into the checkout flow, sellers can display these extra offers in a non-intrusive way, increasing the chances of additional sales without disrupting the customer experience. This not only raises the average transaction value but also strengthens customer relationships by providing personalized and useful recommendations.
